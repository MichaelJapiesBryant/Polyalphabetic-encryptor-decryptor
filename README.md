# Term one Python assignment
## Text encryption using Caesar and Polyalphabetic ciphers

The purpose of this assignment is to create a program that can encrypt and decrypt text files using at least *two* encryption methods. The two encryption methods built into the program are the **Caesar cipher** and **Vigènere cipher** encryption methods.
These two encryption methods are a relavitvely lightweight and effective way to encrypt files. While not the most secure, they still provide some security and will successfully encrypt any text files (Providing that they contain English text. Punctuation and numbers are also encrypted.) 

The features found in this program are; 
- Ability to encrypt a file by using the Caesar cipher
- Ability to decrypt a file that has already been encrypted using the Caesar cipher. 
- Ability to encrypt a file by using the Vigènere cipher. 
- Ability to decrypt a text file that has already been encrypted using a Vigènere cipher. 
- File dialog UI enabling the user to select a text file without the need of the command line.
